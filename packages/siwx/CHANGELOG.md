  Components example:

  ```tsx
  import '@reown/appkit-wallet-button'

  export function YourApp() {
    return (
      <>
        {/* QR Code (WalletConnect) */}
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="walletConnect" />

        {/* Wallets */}
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="metamask" />
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="trust" />
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="coinbase" />

        {/* Socials */}
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="google" />
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="x" />
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="discord" />
        <appkit-wallet-button wallet="farcaster" />
      </>
    )
  }
  ```

  Hook example:

  ```tsx
  import { useAppKitWallet } from '@reown/appkit-wallet-button/react'

  export function YourApp() {
    const { data, error, isPending, isSuccess, isError, connect } = useAppKitWallet({
      onError: err => {
        // ...
      },
      onSuccess: data => {
        // ...
      }
    })

    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={() => connect('walletConnect')}>Open QR modal</button>
        <button onClick={() => connect('metamask')}>Connect to MetaMask</button>
        <button onClick={() => connect('google')}>Connect to Google</button>
      </>
    )
  }
  ```

  Additionally a new theme variable property called `--w3m-qr-color` was added where you can configure a custom color for the QR code.

  ```tsx
  import { createAppKit } from '@reown/appkit/react'

  const modal = createAppKit({
    /* Your Config */
    themeVariables: {
      '--w3m-qr-color': '...', // Optional
      '--w3m-color-mix': '...',
      '--w3m-color-mix-strength': 50
    }
  })
  ```
