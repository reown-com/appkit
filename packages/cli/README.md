## Linking/Unlinking for Local Development

### Linking

If you want to work on the CLI and test it locally without publishing, use `npm link`:

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/appkit-cli
   ```

2. **Run npm link**:
   ```bash
   sudo npm link
   ```

### Unlinking

To remove the symlink and unlink the CLI, use:

```bash
sudo npm unlink -g
```

This will unregister the global command `appkit-cli`, but it wonâ€™t delete any files in your project directory.
