## AppKit Examples Rules

These rules apply to `examples/**`.

### Usage Patterns

- Import from public entrypoints of packages (`@reown/appkit`, `@reown/appkit-adapter-*`).
- Do not deep import internal paths.
- Keep example code minimal, readable, and framework-idiomatic.

### Adapters & Peers

- Respect `peerDependencies`: install `wagmi`/`viem`/`ethers` in examples that need them.
- Prefer the adapter suited to the framework: wagmi for React, ethers for generic EVM, solana adapter for Solana.

### CDN

- For CDN-based examples, use `@reown/appkit-cdn` outputs and ensure polyfills are present when required.
