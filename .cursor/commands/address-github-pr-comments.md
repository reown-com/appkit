# Address GitHub PR Comments

## Overview

Process outstanding reviewer feedback, apply required fixes, and draft clear
responses for each GitHub pull-request comment.

## Steps

1. **Sync and audit comments**
    - Pull the latest branch changes
    - Open the PR conversation view and read every unresolved comment
    - Group comments by affected files or themes
2. **Plan resolutions**
    - List the requested code edits for each thread
    - Identify clarifications or additional context you must provide
    - Note any dependencies or blockers before implementing changes
3. **Implement fixes**
    - Apply targeted updates addressing one comment thread at a time
    - Run relevant tests or linters after impactful changes
    - Stage changes with commits that reference the addressed feedback
4. **Draft responses**
    - Summarize the action taken or reasoning provided for each comment
    - Link to commits or lines when clarification helps reviewers verify
    - Highlight any remaining questions or follow-up needs
