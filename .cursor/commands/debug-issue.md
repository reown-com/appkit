# Debug Issue

Help debug the current issue in the code. Please:

## Problem Analysis

- Identify the specific problem or error
- Understand the expected vs actual behavior
- Trace the execution flow to find the root cause

## Debugging Strategy

- Add appropriate logging statements
- Suggest debugging tools and techniques
- Identify key variables and states to monitor
- Recommend breakpoint locations

## Solution Approach

- Propose potential fixes with explanations
- Consider multiple solution approaches
- Evaluate trade-offs of different approaches
- Provide step-by-step resolution plan

## Prevention

- Suggest ways to prevent similar issues
- Recommend additional tests or checks
- Identify code patterns that could be improved

Walk through the debugging process systematically and provide clear, actionable
solutions.
