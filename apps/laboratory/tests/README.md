# Functional Tests

We use Playwright as our functional test runner. It's configured to try multiple permutations:

- Browsers: Chromium/Firefox
- Modal flavors: default/SIWE/email

## Setup

- Make sure your `.env.local` is set up (see `.env.example` for reference)
- Run `pnpm playwright:install` to install the browsers required to run the tests
- Build AppKit & the Lab by running `pnpm build:laboratory` in the root directory

## Running Tests

- `pnpm playwright:test` to run in default mode.
- `pnpm playwright:debug` to step by step see what the tests are doing

## Debugging

For scenarios when tests pass locally but not remotely you can `await this.page.screenshot({ path: './screenshots/wallet.png' })` and the screenshot will be uploaded to GitHub Actions.

## Running from GitHub Actions

These tests can be run from GitHub Actions both from this and other repositories.

You can tweak what's under test by setting the `BASE_URL` (default 'http://localhost:3000/') and `WALLET_URL` (default 'https://react-wallet.walletconnect.com/') environment variables.
