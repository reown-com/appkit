            ## Context

            A release merge commit (SHA: ${{ github.sha }}) was just pushed to the main branch of the ${{ github.repository }} repository. This commit is the result of merging a release branch back to main after publishing.
            Your task is to analyze the impact of this specific commit on the reown-com/reown-docs repository.

            Please examine the changes introduced by commit ${{ github.sha }} in the ${{ github.repository }} repository. Focus your examination on the content of any `CHANGELOG.md` files modified in this commit. (Note: if multiple CHANGELOG.md files were part of this commit and are identical, examining one is sufficient, as per repository conventions).

            Determine if any of the changes in the `CHANGELOG.md`(s) from this commit necessitate updates to the documentation in the reown-com/reown-docs repository.

            ## Advice
            * If documentation updates are required, create a pull request in the reown-com/reown-docs repository. The pull request should:
                * Include the necessary documentation updates reflecting the changes from the appkit changelog.
                * Contain a clear description of why the updates are needed, referencing the specific changes from the appkit repository.
                * Include a link back to the original "chore: version packages" commit in the ${{ github.repository }} repository (Commit: ${{ github.server_url }}/${{ github.repository }}/commit/${{ github.sha }}).
                * Assign the following Github teams as reviewers in the pull request: @reown-com/appkit-web-team, @reown-com/devrel-team
            * If no documentation updates are needed, clearly state this conclusion. You do not need to open a pull request in this case. Simply report that no updates are necessary based on your analysis of the changelog.
            * You will need to operate within the following repositories: ${{ github.repository }} (for reading the changelog of the commit) and reown-com/reown-docs (for potentially creating a PR with documentation updates).
