        This should include as little code as possible, and no extraneous dependencies. Do not share your entire project.
        You should also test your issue against the latest NPM package version(s) to ensure that it hasn't already been resolved.
        Sharing a link to a GitHub repository or preview deployment are best. Include any instructions to run the project in the README or the summary field below.

        IF A REPRODUCIBLE DEMO IS NOT PROVIDED, YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED.
